# Game List Mobile App
This is a Game List app where you can browse video games and read their details such as their platforms, Metacritic scores, and more!  

## Used technology
I have created this app using <b> <ins> React Native</ins> </b>, so you can use it with either an iOS or an Android device!

## How to run?
1) You should download the folder, and open it inside a terminal. <br/>
`cd 'Game List Mobile App/List App'`
2) Then you should install all the dependencies (I used Node): <br/>
`npm i`
3) Finally, you start the app: <br/>
`npm start`
